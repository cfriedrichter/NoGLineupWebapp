# NoGLineupWebapp
Small and lightweight (offline) WebApp that enables you to prelisten to the whole Lineup of my favorite Festival Nation of Gondwana.
This is a non commercial educational funproject to get into WebApps and Ai-Driven development/administration processes.

# Currently, you can: 
1. Sort the artists of the lineup 
2. Click them to get to their SoundCloud profiles 
3. Add favorites to your list 

# Wishlist/Comming Soon
1. Scheduling Feature
2. Artist Info
3. Interactive Camp Site Map (tent marker, position)
4. Better Ai-Training:
   • Research Artist Info
   • Research Artist Profile Links

#NOTE: 
This is not an official product of the nation of Gondwana or any of their associated companies/partners. This WebApp is made by fans for fans.
User at your own risk.
